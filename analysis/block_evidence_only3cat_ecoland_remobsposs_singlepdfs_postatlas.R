# this version prints an obsposs block map using the code from 
# https://github.com/nmanich/small-ebird-scripts/blob/master/obsposs_filtering.R
# Basically obsposs records are overwritten as H possible records for printing

# Script to add highest breeding evidence level to WBBA blocks. Results are exported to
# shapefile.

# NMA 11/09/23
#This version only displays Confirmed, Probable, Possible Codes
#This version has the blocks draw over the county lines
#This version adds an optional ecological landscapes layer
