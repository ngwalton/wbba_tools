# This script was written to help streamline data validation for WBBA eBird
# data. It checks if breeding code is unlikely or date is out of expected range,
# then prints a CSV file of suspect records. Validation tags for date range and
# breeding code are written to columns "dv_date" and "dv_code" respectively. NA
# values in these columns indicate that no issue was found for that particular
# parameter.
